	<h1>Hello! My name is Rahal and Welcome to my page!</h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>My name is Rahal Abeyrathna and I am 18, turning 19 this May.<br>My student code is s3781696 and email is s3781696@student.rmit.edu.au </p>
	<p>My nationality is Sri Lankan however I was born in Australia on May 10th 2000 and I am actually really bad
	at speaking Sinhalese. </p>
<p>	Prior to RMIT, I went to Glen Waverley Secondary College and studied Futher Maths, English Language, Psychology,
	Software Development and Media. <br>
	I also did a traineeship for a company called Lightmare Studios which counted as my 6th subject while also getting paid! </p>
<p> As for my interesting fact, I recently got a pet bird, her name is Luma (no, not Luna) and she is a Green Cheek Conure. She is such a sweetheart but also <br>
  the biggest brat as she constantly needs your attention.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT:</h2>
<p><strong> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</strong></p>
	<br> 
	My Dad was a technician in the past and because of this, I would always be interested in watching him help fix computers and messing with the insides of PC's which looked like rocket science to 6 year old me.
	<br>I also got access to lots of different types of technology like game consoles and computers because of my Dad and since then, I've always been really interested in technology and how it works.
	<br>I decided to take Software Development as one of my VCE subjects which helped build my passion for IT and afterwards I decided that IT was something that I wanted to persue as a career.
	
	
<p><strong>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </strong></p>
	<br> I chose to come to RMIT as I learnt that RMIT has a really good reputation on the technical side of education and I also heard that RMIT was a lot more hands-on and practical compared to other
	<br> uni's such as Monash.
	
	<p><strong>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</strong></p>
	<br>I hope to learn the necessary skills I will need to persue a job in the IT field, specifically for networking and Sysadmin duties. This includes basic networking knowledge such as protocols and the hardware
	<br>associated. I also want to learn basic programming and database management as it may be crucial to finding a job in the Sysadmin field. I would also hope to learn more about Linux and Command-Line interfaces
	<br>as Linux is a really interesting operating system which may also be very important for potential job opportunities.
	
	
<h2>Ideal Job:</h2>
	<p>This is a job advertisement that I found on Seek.com</p>
	<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/38545564?type=standard&searchrequesttoken=e57def46-7446-4cd8-801d-f7e2dd7a108d</p>

	<p>
		<p><strong>Short Description-</strong></p>
		This job advertisement is for a position as a System Administrator which is what I am particularly interested in becoming after completing Uni. I am really interested in being part of the team that manages the system and networks
		that others depend on and I wouldn't mind being in a helpdesk-like position.
		<br>This advertisement also states that knowledge in linux is required which I do not currently have but I am very interested in learning how to use
		linux as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		<p><strong>Necessary Skils and Experience-</strong></p>
		In order to get this position, I require 4 years of IT experience previously as a SysAdmin so I would need to look for a junior position or work my way up in another company before I would be able to apply for this position.
		<br>I also need 2 years supporting Windows and Linux which means I would need to take time to look into and learn the functioning of Linux as a whole.
		<br>The advertisement also states I need experience automating processes with Powershell which I have no experience in whatsoever so I would need to look into that and start learning how to do that before I would apply for this
		position.
		<br>It also states I need an in-depth knowledge of Microsoft Azure which I had not even heard of until stumbling upon this job advert.
		<br>The job also required knowledge in managaging virtualization technologies which I do not really have but I have expereimented a little with virtual box which may be a step in the right direction.
	</p>
	<p>
		I believe I already have the ability to learn in a fast-paced environment and that this is something that I could adapt to very easily.
		<br>I've also worked in retail and fast food so I believe that my customer service skills will be more than adequete to deal with the expectations of this job.
		<br>I'm also slowly working on my CompTIA A+ 901 and 902 certification which will help me get the basic IT knowledege which could help me stand out a little when applying for this job.
